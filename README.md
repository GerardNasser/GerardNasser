## 🔬 About Me

I'm a passionate bioinformatics PhD student at the **University of North Carolina at Charlotte (UNCC)**, where I spend my days (and nights) turning biological mysteries into computational solutions. When I'm not working with genomic data or debugging pipelines, you can find me exploring the intersection of biology, data science, software engineering, and AI.

```python
class BioinformaticsStudent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "Gerard N."
        self.current_biology_focus = ["Genomics", "Enviromental Microbiomes", "Hi-C Sequence Analysis"]
        self.current_informatics_focus = ["Pipeline Development", "Data Visualization", "Documentation"]
        self.sleep_dependency = "Minimal"
        self.debugging_skills = "A-Rank"
    
    def daily_routine(self):
        return ["🥡 Take Out", "💻 Code", "🧬 Science", "🔄 Repeat"]
```

## 🎯 Fun Projects (Because Science Should Be Fun!)

<details>
<summary>🎮 Click here for the fun stuff!</summary>
- **📚 D&D Character Information Website**: A Git Pages site to showcase the backstory of one of my DND characters. This project also provided me an introduction to HTML and website building. Future plans are to add more pages and interactive elements.
- **🃏 MCP for the Scryfall API**: Still a work-in-progress and in the early stages, but to learn MCPs I am making one for the Scryfall API. As a big fan of Magic: The Gathering, this was an entertaining way to learn.
